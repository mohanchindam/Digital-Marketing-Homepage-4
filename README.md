# Mohan Chindam

- It was a simple project compared to the previous one.
- Wasted time, or you can say I took 25% time on coloring using Colorzilla which was not working properly.
- I learned nothing new but polished my element sizing, margin, and positioning skills.
- It took nearly one hour to complete this project as it is similar to the previous one. 
- Improved in computing the sizes of elements.

- Below image shows the preview of the project:
